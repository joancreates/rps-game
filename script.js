//The game is going to have 5 rounds.

//Each time a player wins. The round ends and new round begins.

//When the rounds count equals 5 the game ends and the player with more rounds won wins the game.

//Each round is going to have the following sequence:

//Get input from 2 players( User / Machine )

//There's 3 inputs allowed "Rock", "Paper", and "Scissors"

//There's 3 possible initial scenarios:

//1. If the user inputs Rock and the Machine inputs Scissors.
//   The user wins and the Machine loses.

//2. If the user inputs Scissors and the Machine inputs Paper.
//   The user wins and the machine loses.

//3. If the user inputs Paper and the Machine inputs Rock.
//   The user wins and the machine loses.

//- If the opposite happens on each scenario. The user loses and the Machine wins.
